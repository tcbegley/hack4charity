Amnesty International - Hack4Charity
==============================

This repository stores the results of a hackathon I took part in organised by Amnesty International and Accenture Analytics.

The problem was to try and gain insights into abuse of female MPs on twitter. We were provided with all tweets mentioning female MPs that were tweeted between 1^(st) January and the general election on 8^(th) June.
